# The label command

In this lesson we will learn how to work with labels. By the end of this lesson you will be able to print your name everywhere on the screen.

The label command is `label` followed by text. Typing this will take the text (a string) and print it on the screen in the direction in which the turtle is heading. Keep in mind that in order to print a text we have to first define the text with an open quotation mark.

For example: `label "hello` should print a hello message.

Write "turtle" to the screen.
```result
label "turtle
```
