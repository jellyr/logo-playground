While the pen is up, moving the turtle will not create any new lines.
You have now seen that the turtle moved forward without drawing any new lines. In order to continue drawing we should command the turtle to put the pen back down on the drawing board using the command `pendown`.

Ask the turtle to put the pen down and walk 30 points forward.
