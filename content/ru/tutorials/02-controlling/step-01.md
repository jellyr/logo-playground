# What is the pen?
Imagine that Logo's turtle, the one we have gotten to know in the past lesson, is holding a pen in his hand while he's walking. He is using the pen to draw a line of his movement whenever he receives a command such as to go forward.

Ask the turtle to go 30 points forward and watch the line he draws.
