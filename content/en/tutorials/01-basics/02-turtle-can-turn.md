The crucial thing about the turtle is that the turtle is pointing in a particular direction and can only move in that direction. (It can move forward or back, like a car with reverse gear, but not sideways.) In order to draw in any other direction, the turtle must first turn so that it is facing in the new direction.

The turn orders are `left` or `right` followed by a number. 
The number tells the turtle at which angle he should turn. 
A full turn, turning around at a full circle, is 360 degrees.

A command to turn the turtle 90 degrees (a "right angle") to the right side will be `right 90`

Make the turtle turn right.

```init
forward 50
```

```result
forward 50
right 90
```
