# The Turtle can Turn
We can make the turtle turn. The turn orders are left or right followed by a number. 
The words "left" and "right" tell the turtle which side to turn to. 
The number tells the turtle at which angle he should turn. 
A full turn , turning around at a full circle, is 360 degrees. 
A command to turn the turtle 90 degrees (a "right angle") to the right side will be ```right 90```

Make the turtle turn right
