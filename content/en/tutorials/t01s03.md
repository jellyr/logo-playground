# Turning back
To turn the turtle backwards you need to make it take a 180 degree turn. 
In this case, there is no difference whether you make it turn to the left side or to the right side. 
Either way the turtle will be looking back the way he came :)

Turn backwards using the turning ```left``` command.

```result
forward 50
right 90
left 180
```
