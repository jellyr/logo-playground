# The inverted letter L

The letter L is really easy to draw, and so is the inverted letter L.
The inverted letter L will be just like the letter L  only upside down and backwards ðŸ™‚. 
If you'll notice, we are halfway drawing it already. 
If the turtle will move forward now, the inverted letter L will be completed.
