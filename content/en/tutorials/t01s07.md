# Shortcuts

We can use shortcuts to some commands. Instead of "right" it's enought to write rt . Instead of "left" write lt instead of "forward" write fd instead of "clearscreen" cs . Now we can draw the inverted L using the short command.

Draw again the inverted L with three shortcut commands size 50 / 30.

```result
fd 50 lt 90 fd 30
```
