# Logo's turtle
Hello, I am Logo, and I can help you make some awesome things happen :) First let me show you around and explain: The box on the right is my drawing box. In the center of the drawing box is the turtle. You can control the turtle using Logo commands. With those commands you can use the turtle to draw beautiful shapes. You type in the Logo commands in the box below the drawing box which is also known as the command box. To start typing in orders please click the mouse inside the command box. To repeat previous commands we will use the up / down arrow keys on the keyboard. The first command you will learn will move the turtle forward. This command is simply called forward followed by a number. The number indicates how far the turtle moves forward. Let's try it:

Write down the command forward 50

```result
forward 50
