# Shortcuts

We can use shortcuts to some commands.
For example instead of ```right``` it's enought to write ```rt``` . In table below are shown full and short versions of commands that we already know.

| Full command  | Short command |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ```forward``` | ```fd```      |
| ```right```   | ```rt```      |
| ```left```    | ```lt```      |


Now we can draw the inverted L using the short commands.

Draw again the inverted L with three shortcut commands size 50 / 30.

```result
fd 50 lt 90 fd 30
```
