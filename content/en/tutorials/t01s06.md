# Combining commands

With Logo you can type in a few commands in one command row, one after the other. You need to put a space between one command and the next. For example: forward 50 left 90.

Let's draw the inverted L, using only one command row that includes 3 commands.

Draw an inverted L. The lines of the letter should be 50 point each in length. Do so using only one command row that consists of three commands.

```result
forward 50 left 90 forward 50
```
